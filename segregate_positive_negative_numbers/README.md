> Always start by writing pseudocode or outlining a guide for your solution.
Include considerations for how the code will be structured. 
The focus during actual coding should be on implementation details such as loop types and logic. 
However, the overall structure and placement of loops should already be well-defined in your pseudocode or plan.
