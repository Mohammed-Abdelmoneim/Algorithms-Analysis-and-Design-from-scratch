## Huffman Coding
-   N = unique chars count
-   Auxiliary Messeage Ensembles count = N - 1
-   Extra Rows count = N - 1
<br/>

## How it works?
> • Sum first two frequencies <br/>
> • Sort the output in the table in the next colmun <br/>
> • Move the remain frequencies to the next colmun 

<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Properties of Huffman Coding:
> - No code could be used for more than one char.
> - No code could be the same of other code prefix.
> - Long codes used for the least frequency chars.

## Data Structures 
- Priority Queue is Min-Heap or Max-Heap. <br/>
- Heap is a complete Binary tree. <br/>
- Binary tree is a collection of related nodes. <br/>
- Node is an object has data and references to another data.
