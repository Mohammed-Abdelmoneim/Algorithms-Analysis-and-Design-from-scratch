# NOTES

> [!NOTE]
> • Greedy Algo is **ONE** approach to solving optimization problems. <br /> <br />
> • The Greedy method is applied to problems where a sequence of steps can be taken,
    and at each step, the algorithm makes the locally optimal choice, aiming for a globally optimal solution.


## Elements of greedy strategy
- Sequential choices
- Local optimal solution (greedy choice)

## How to know Greedy Algo will be applicable?
- greedy-choice property (Each step involves making a decision from available options)
- optimal substructure (These choices ultimately led to a result or outcome)


> **Example**
> Hiring process (usually greedy)
