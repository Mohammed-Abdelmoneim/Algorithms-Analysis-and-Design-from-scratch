## Notes

> -> The best solution is not always the one with the best complexity class. <br />
> -> The most convenient solution is not always the one with the best complexity class.

> • Always start by writing pseudocode or outlining a guide for your solution. <br />
> • Include considerations for how the code will be structured. <br />
> • The focus during actual coding should be on implementation details such as loop types and logic. <br />
> • However, the overall structure and placement of loops should already be well-defined in your pseudocode or plan.
